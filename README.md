## Functionality
If we had to give a functionality list it would be the following:

###  :file\_folder: Persistence
The Persistence was configured using the H2 engine, which provides with the 
possibility to register entities, and allows for editing certain values of the
mentioned entities. The important information regarding the H2 documentation can 
be found at: 

- [H2 official documentation](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- [H2 Github](https://github.com/h2database/h2database)

###  :computer:	UI
The UI was created using the Swing Framework. Swing allows for different elements which
composes every "view". The views in our app are composed of JFrame, which may or may not
have different pannels inside, containing the relevant "Components". Examples of the views:

![Register View](src/registro.png "Register View")
<h5 align="center">Register View</h5>

![Login View](src/login.png "Login View")
<h5 align="center">Login View</h5>

![Main View](src/recents.png "Main View")
<h5 align="center">Main View</h5>
